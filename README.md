# Analyzing Fentanyl Precursor Chemical Flows 

## Executive Summary
The proliferation of synthetic opioids, particularly Fentanyl, poses a significant threat to public health and safety in the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) seeks to combat this epidemic by identifying and tracking the flows of Fentanyl precursor chemicals into the country. This project aims to assist DHS in achieving these objectives through time series analysis of trade volume data as well as other predictive models.

### Objectives
- **Chemical Pathways Shifts**: Investigate whether the chemical pathways used to create Fentanyl from precursors shift in prevalence over time and explore the predictability of these shifts.
- **Supply Chain Identification**: Identify various components of the Fentanyl supply chain and forecast activity from this supply chain.

### Methodology
- **Data Collection**: The data used in this project was provided by the relevant body and is freely available online [via this link](https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=ComTrade&f=_l1Code:30)


- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The aim here is to understand the distribution, patterns, and trends in precursor chemical trade volume over time.

- **Supply Chain Analysis**: Utilize network analysis or clustering techniques to identify components of the Fentanyl supply chain.

### Results and Insights
- Identification of temporal shifts in chemical pathways used to create Fentanyl.
- Forecasts of future trends in precursor chemical imports.
- Identification of key players and components in the Fentanyl supply chain.
- Recommendations for DHS to enhance monitoring and enforcement efforts.

### Conclusion
By leveraging time series analysis and supply chain analysis techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights into understanding and tracking the flows of Fentanyl precursor chemicals into the United States. The findings can inform policy decisions, enforcement strategies, and collaborative efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and protect public health and safety.
